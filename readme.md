# HTML5 Canvas Drawing App

This is a simple drawing app created using HTML5 Canvas and Vanilla JavaScript. With this app, you can draw, select the brush size and color of your choice, and even save your canvas drawing as a JPEG image. There are also some additional features planned for future development.

## Features

-   **Drawing:** Use your mouse input to draw on the canvas.

-   **Brush Customization:** You can select the brush size and color that suits your artistic needs.

-   **Save as JPEG:** Save your canvas drawing as a JPEG image with the click of a button.

## To-Do for Future Development

-   **Responsive Design:** Make the app responsive to different screen sizes, especially for mobile devices and make the canvas respond to touch events.

-   **Shapes:** Implement drawing shapes such as lines, rectangles, and circles, with the ability to fill them with color.

-   **Eraser:** Add an eraser tool to erase parts of your canvas drawing.
